// back either way — the header needs to know there is something in the trash
// before the user has asked to see it, which is the whole point when the delete
// happened overnight through an agent.
//
// A customer contact gets the same shape with everything internal left out:
// internal tasks, internal comments in the counts, and the trash, which is the
// team's own housekeeping.
